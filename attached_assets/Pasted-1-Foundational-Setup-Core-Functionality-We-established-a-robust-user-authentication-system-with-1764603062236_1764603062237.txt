1. Foundational Setup & Core Functionality:

We established a robust user authentication system with two distinct roles: Admins and Dealers.
We created the core "Buy" and "Sell" forms, allowing dealers to submit vehicle requests and list their inventory.
We built an admin area with pages to manage dealer applications, view all inventory, and see customer demand.
2. Major Architectural Shift (Moving Off Black Book):

We completely removed the dependency on the external Black Book API for vehicle valuations. This involved deleting the .env file, the Black Book service, and several AI flows.
We re-engineered the appraisal logic to source all vehicle and market data directly from your own internal Firestore database, making your app self-reliant.
3. Advanced Feature Development & UI Enhancements:

Advanced Inventory Filtering: We built a comprehensive filtering system for the inventory page, including sliders for price/year, multi-select dropdowns for make/model, and various other criteria to allow for precise data analysis.
VIN Search Tool: We created a dedicated page where dealers can enter a VIN, have our AI decode it to identify the vehicle, and then instantly see similar cars from your existing inventory.
Performance Optimization: We significantly improved the speed and responsiveness of the inventory page by implementing component memoization and debouncing the search input, ensuring a smooth experience even with large amounts of data.
4. Security, Access Control, and Bug Fixes:

We resolved multiple Missing or insufficient permissions errors by updating both the Firestore security rules and client-side code to ensure all authorized admin emails have the correct access.
We refined the navigation logic to create a clear separation between user roles. Admins now see only management tools, and we streamlined the Dealer view to provide a focused experience, showing them only the "Carsellia Appraisals" tool as you requested.
In short, we've transformed the application from a simple listing service into a powerful, data-driven appraisal and inventory management platform with distinct, secure roles for admins and dealers, all powered by your own internal data.
